# Polynomial Constant Finder ðŸ§®

This project is a Java application that calculates the constant term 'c' of a polynomial. It reads the polynomial's roots from a structured `input.json` file and computes the result based on established mathematical principles.

## ðŸ’¡ Methodology

The solution is based on **Vieta's formulas**, a fundamental theorem in algebra that relates a polynomial's coefficients to the sums and products of its roots.

For a monic polynomial (where the leading coefficient is 1) of degree **`m`**, the constant term **`c`** is given by the formula:
**`c = (-1)^m * (product of all roots)`**

The degree `m` is determined from the input value `k` using the formula **`m = k - 1`**. The program uses Java's `BigInteger` class to handle calculations involving very large numbers and to convert values from different number bases.
